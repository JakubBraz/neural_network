This repository contains a [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)) implementation written in Rust. No framework or library is used, everything is created from scratch.  
To test the accuracy of the implementation, I created a webpage and I deployed a model trained to recognize hand written digits, you can find it at:
